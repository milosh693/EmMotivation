# Fixing Git Remote URL Error (2025-04-06 21:56:27)

_**User**_

Please explain why this issue is happening and how to fix it

---

_**Assistant**_

<think>
The issue is related to the Git command for adding a remote repository. Let's analyze the error message:

```
PS C:\Users\milos\OneDrive\Coding\Ema motivator> git remote add origin @https://github.com/milosh693/EmMotivation.git
PS C:\Users\milos\OneDrive\Coding\Ema motivator> git push -u origin main
fatal: protocol '@https' is not supported
```

The error message "fatal: protocol '@https' is not supported" is occurring because there's an `@` symbol at the beginning of the HTTPS URL when adding the remote repository.

The correct format for adding a GitHub remote repository using HTTPS should be:
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/milosh693/EmMotivation.git
```

Instead, the command used was:
```
git remote add origin @https://github.com/milosh693/EmMotivation.git
```

The `@` symbol at the beginning of the URL is causing Git to interpret `@https` as a protocol, which is not a valid Git protocol. The valid Git protocols include `https://`, `git://`, `ssh://`, etc.

The solution is to remove the `@` symbol from the beginning of the URL when adding the remote repository.

# Git Remote URL Error

## The Problem

You're getting an error when trying to push to GitHub:

```
fatal: protocol '@https' is not supported
```

This is happening because you have an extra `@` symbol at the beginning of your GitHub URL when you added the remote repository:

```
git remote add origin @https://github.com/milosh693/EmMotivation.git
```

## The Solution

You need to remove the remote and add it again with the correct URL format:

1. First, remove the incorrect remote:
```bash
git remote remove origin
```

2. Then add it correctly (without the @ symbol):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/milosh693/EmMotivation.git
```

3. Now you can push your code:
```bash
git push -u origin main
```

The correct URL format for HTTPS connections to GitHub is simply `https://github.com/username/repository.git` without any `@` symbol prefixing the protocol.

I have changed one of the assets and a bit of the code. I ran git add -u. Prepare a commit and a push command for me to copy and paste

_**Assistant**_

<think>
You've changed some assets and code, and you've already run `git add -u` which stages all modified tracked files. Now you need to commit these changes and push them to the remote repository.

I'll prepare the commands for committing and pushing:

1. First, a git commit command with a meaningful message. Since I don't know exactly what changes you made, I'll use a general message.

2. Then a git push command to push your changes to the remote repository.

Since you already added the modified files with `git add -u`, you're ready to commit and push.
</think>

Here are the commands to commit and push your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "Update assets and code modifications"
git push origin main
```

Just copy and paste these commands into your terminal. The first command commits your changes with a descriptive message, and the second pushes those changes to the main branch on your GitHub repository.

If your branch is named differently (like "master" instead of "main"), replace "main" with your branch name in the push command.
